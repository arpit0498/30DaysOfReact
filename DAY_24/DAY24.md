    SO in terminal type the following commands in your destination folder

<img src="./Assets/Terminal/create-react-app.png">Create react app songs<img>
<img src="./Assets/Terminal/redux-library.png"> Install libraries<img>

After these steps type   :
        
        cd songs

So for creating the song app we have to divide the song app into two major components

-SongList

-SongDetail
